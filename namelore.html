<h2 style="color:white; padding-left:5px">The lore of the name "icepicket"</h2>
<p style="color:white; padding-left:10px">When Geometry Dash 2.2 came out, so called "lobtomy levels" got popular. My username was shitty so I wanted a new one. So I started thinking. I knew what a lobotomy was:
 Shoving an ice picket into someone's skull to somehow cure mental illnesses. Then it hit me. "icepicket" is a good name. I'm gonna use that!
 It was my GD account's name for a while. Then I stopped playing. I created a YouTube channel and a Discord account with the name "Lihapaskeija". Not going to tell you what
 that means in finnish... Then I realized that english speaking people can't pronounce it, so I brought back my GD name. And then i got the stupid idea to create a website.
 I created this website (after watching a tutorial). Then my mom asked me what the name meant. I realized using a lobotomy tool as a name kind of wasn't a good move.
 Then I just googled it and turns out an ice picket is also a tool for breaking ice. So the name's fine. And that's how I ended up with the name, if you were wondering.
 Also props for reading all this. Seems like you have an <em>attention span</em>. (Something REALLY rare nowadays.)</p>
